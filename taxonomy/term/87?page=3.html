            <div class="paragraph full-html field-formatted-text text-long label-hidden"><p>The Kofi Annan Foundation has tapped four Stanford scholars at the&nbsp;<a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/">Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies</a>&nbsp;(FSI) to help advance one of its top priorities: to shed light on the rapidly-changing role of technology in elections around the world and to recommend ways of ensuring that digital tools strengthen—not undercut—democracy.</p><p>To that end, the foundation has formed the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age and named&nbsp;<a href="https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/people/stephen_j_stedman">Stephen Stedman</a>, a senior fellow at&nbsp;<a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/">FSI</a>&nbsp;and deputy director of its&nbsp;<a href="https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law</a>&nbsp;(CDDRL), to serve as its secretary general.&nbsp;The Chair of the commission is the former president of Costa Rica, Laura Chinchilla.</p><p>Stedman is joined on the commission by Stanford colleagues&nbsp;<a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/alex-stamos-0">Alex Stamos</a>, the former chief security officer of Facebook who came to FSI as an adjunct professor earlier this year;&nbsp;<a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/toomas-hendrik-ilves">Toomas Hendrik Ilves</a>, the ex-president of Estonia who is now an affiliate of FSI's&nbsp;<a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>&nbsp;(CISAC); and&nbsp;<a href="https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/people/nathaniel-persily">Nathaniel Persily</a>, an FSI affiliate and Stanford Law School professor.</p><p>In addition, the commission's work will be run through the university's&nbsp;<a href="https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/research/project-on-democracy-and-the-internet/">Project on Democracy and the Internet</a>, which is a partnership of FSI, the law school, and the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society (<a href="https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/">Stanford PACS</a>).</p><p>Kofi Annan, the former head of the United Nations and founder of the non-profit that bears his name, formed the commission earlier this year. In May, Annan&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLohOwb_R1s">visited Stanford</a>&nbsp;to recruit for the commission and discuss his concerns about the growing role of the Internet—and social media, specifically—in elections worldwide.</p><p>"Kofi Annan always viewed electoral integrity as a bedrock principle in democracy and undertook a number of initiatives to counteract any attempt to undermine the voting process," said Stedman, who has led two other high-profile Annan initiatives over 15 years. "The rise of social media, fake news, hate news—the whole 'witches brew' of threats to electoral integrity globally—was of particular concern to him."</p><p>The commission's mandate is expansive: to "examine and review the opportunities for electoral integrity created by technological innovations," according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kofiannanfoundation.org/our-work/kofi-annan-commission/">foundation statement</a>. Stedman adds that the plan calls for members to meet periodically before issuing their findings and recommendations before the end of 2019. As secretary general, Stedman will oversee the research and writing of the commission's final report.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, a number of high-profile initiatives have been launched in response to technology's negative impact on the electoral process. The Kofi Annan Foundation's effort stands out for its range of expertise, said Persily: The 12 members hail from government, business, academia, and civil society and have all dealt firsthand with technology's promise and pitfalls.</p><p>"The diverse membership on this commission brings the expertise and political skills necessary to tackle these questions," said Persily. "My guess is that we won't all agree on either the nature of the problem or how to address it, but that will force us to build consensus and come up with recommendations that will make an impact." Persily co-directs the Project on Democracy and the Internet along with CDDRL director&nbsp;<a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/fukuyama">Francis Fukuyama</a>&nbsp;and also leads&nbsp;<a href="https://socialscience.one/">Social Science One</a>, a new global initiative in which academics are granted special access to Facebook data in the hopes of generating insights into social media's impact on elections around the world.</p><p>Another notable feature is the commission's geographic scope. "The United States and Europe are easy targets," said Ilves, who is involved in a number of other high-profile initiatives on technology and elections. "But the problem extends beyond the rich, northern hemisphere and that is not on people's radar screens."&nbsp;</p><p>In a sign of just how urgent the role of digital tools in global elections has become, Stedman led a similar Kofi Annan Foundation commission in 2012.</p><p>"We had a lot to say six years ago about the problems affecting the integrity of elections," said Stedman, citing unfettered campaign finance and barriers to participation as examples. "But we did not anticipate the role that social media would come to play."</p></div>

	<p>Whether it’s foreign government meddling or corporate hacking, every day brings a new challenge in cybersecurity for the United States, said experts at a recent Hoover Institution media roundtable.</p>

	<p>Fifteen members of the national media attended the October 1 discussion, “Outside the Beltway,” which included talks by scholars from the Hoover Institution and Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), cosponsors of the full-day event. The media included the Wall Street Journal, NBC, CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, The Hill, CNET, Politico, The Washington Free Beacon, Axios, and RealClear Politics, among others.</p>

	<p>Speakers included Herb Lin, Hoover research fellow and senior research scholar at CISAC; Alex Stamos, Hoover visiting scholar and CISAC fellow; Andrew Grotto, Hoover research fellow and research scholar at CISAC: John Villasenor, Hoover senior fellow; Irving Lachow, Hoover visiting fellow; Sean Kanuck, Hoover visiting fellow; Max Smeets, CISAC postdoctoral fellow; and Gregory Falco, CISAC postdoctoral fellow; and others from the private sector.</p>

	<p><strong>Cyber conflicts</strong></p>

	<p>Grotto said many cyber attackers disguise their operations by using another country’s cyber facilities and locations. He describes this as “third country issues,” which occur in cyberspace as well as on other fronts.</p>

	<p>During the Cold War, for example, the Soviet Union used Mexico City as a base of covert operations against the United States, according to Grotto. Even though the United States lodged complaints with the Mexican government, the latter continued to allow the Soviet influence-peddling and spying activities.</p>

	<p>Kanuck described how trends in cyberspace are producing outcomes such as “fake news,” “fake” and real crime, European data regulation, and an inability to develop unified, international approaches to cyber deterrence.</p>

	<p>Looking ahead, he said we may encounter the first death from a malicious cyber activity, limitations on some cloud services, and continued attempts by foreign and domestic groups to influence elections through social media.</p>

	<p>“This is a weapon and a space that is designed to help authoritarians,” Kanuck said, noting that open societies are much more vulnerable to cyber meddling than closed ones that can block websites, and censor and surveil their own people.</p>

	<p>Finally, the world will likely one day witness the first official state-sponsored and acknowledged response to a cyberattack, Kanuck added. Russia, for example, is “clearly sending geopolitical signals” about its cyber strengths with its activities.</p>

	<p><strong>“Persistent Engagement”</strong></p>

	<p>With “bad actors” in Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, Lin talked about current US policy in cyberspace and the “good, bad, and the ugly” of the situation. The US government’s recently unveiled strategy is dubbed “persistent engagement.”</p>

	<p>Lin said that while the United States may understand the cyber domain it operates in, the prescribed “medicine” is not well understood. He explained that such an approach is untested, and it is unclear whether current assumptions about the nature of the threats will reduce cyber threats.</p>

	<p>“There is no evidence from history of anywhere else to indicate that this strategy will lead to restraint on the part of the adversaries,” Lin said.</p>

	<p>Max Smeets, a CISAC post-doctoral scholar, said it is not certain if current US cyber strategy is actually more aggressive, as not enough operational details exist right now. He spoke about his research into “cyber proliferation” and the difficulty of knowing exactly how many more states than the four noted “bad actors” are building serious offensive capabilities.</p>

	<p><strong>“Low Hum”</strong></p>

	<p>Asked about Russian election hacking in the 2018 midterms, Kevin Mandia, a speaker and CEO of the cybersecurity company FireEye, said, “We’re not responding to an elevated state of Russian activity right now. It’s more of a low hum,” different than what his company found during the 2016 election season.</p>

	<p>He suggested that relying on diplomacy and holding nations accountable—and not following the “a good offense is the best defense” strategy—is a realistic approach to dealing with cybersecurity threats from closed society states.</p>

	<p>The roundtable topics covered technical issues in cyber, cyber challenges past and present, cyber conflict, countries, companies, and cyber challenges, among others. The event also included a two-hour simulation exercise with participants assuming the roles of executives at a large, fictitious company that was under a major cyberattack.</p>

            <div class="node people body text-with-summary label-hidden text-long"><p>Alex Stamos is a cybersecurity expert, business leader and entrepreneur working to improve the security and safety of the Internet. Stamos was the founding director of the Stanford Internet Observatory at the Cyber Policy Center, a part of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. He is currently a lecturer, teaching in both the Masters in International Policy Program and in Computer Science.</p><p>Prior to joining Stanford, Alex served as the Chief Security Officer of Facebook. In this role, Stamos led a team of engineers, researchers, investigators and analysts charged with understanding and mitigating information security risks to the company and safety risks to the 2.5 billion people on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. During his time at Facebook, he led the company’s investigation into manipulation of the 2016 US election and helped pioneer several successful protections against these new classes of abuse. As a senior executive, Alex represented Facebook and Silicon Valley to regulators, lawmakers and civil society on six continents, and has served as a bridge between the interests of the Internet policy community and the complicated reality of platforms operating at billion-user scale. In April 2017, he co-authored “Information Operations and Facebook”, a highly cited examination of the influence campaign against the US election, which still stands as the most thorough description of the issue by a major technology company.</p><p>Before joining Facebook, Alex was the Chief Information Security Officer at Yahoo, rebuilding a storied security team while dealing with multiple assaults by nation-state actors. While at Yahoo, he led the company’s response to the Snowden disclosures by implementing massive cryptographic improvements in his first months. He also represented the company in an open hearing of the US Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.</p><p>In 2004, Alex co-founded iSEC Partners, an elite security consultancy known for groundbreaking work in secure software development, embedded and mobile security. As a trusted partner to world’s largest technology firms, Alex coordinated the response to the “Aurora” attacks by the People’s Liberation Army at multiple Silicon Valley firms and led groundbreaking work securing the world’s largest desktop and mobile platforms. During this time, he also served as an expert witness in several notable civil and criminal cases, such as the Google Street View incident and pro bono work for the defendants in Sony vs George Hotz and US vs Aaron Swartz. After the 2010 acquisition of iSEC Partners by NCC Group, Alex formed an experimental R&amp;D division at the combined company, producing five patents.</p><p>A noted speaker and writer, he has appeared at the Munich Security Conference, NATO CyCon, Web Summit, DEF CON, CanSecWest and numerous other events. His 2017 keynote at Black Hat was noted for its call for a security industry more representative of the diverse people it serves and the actual risks they face. Throughout his career, Alex has worked toward making security a more representative field and has highlighted the work of diverse technologists as an organizer of the Trustworthy Technology Conference and OURSA.</p><p>Alex has been involved with securing the US election system as a contributor to Harvard’s Defending Digital Democracy Project and involved in the academic community as an advisor to Stanford’s Cybersecurity Policy Program and UC Berkeley’s Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity. He is a member of the Aspen Institute’s Cyber Security Task Force, the Bay Area CSO Council and the Council on Foreign Relations. Alex also serves on the advisory board to NATO’s Collective Cybersecurity Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia.</p></div>

<p>Stanford University’s <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/">Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies</a> and the <a href="https://www.hoover.org/">Hoover Institution</a> announced today the appointment of Alex Stamos as a William J. Perry Fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation (<a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/">CISAC</a>), Cyber Initiative fellow, and Hoover visiting scholar.</p>

<p>Stamos, a computer security expert and the outgoing chief security officer at Facebook, will engage in teaching, research and policy engagement through CISAC and the Hoover Institution's Cyber Policy Program as well as the Stanford Cyber Initiative. Drawing on his considerable experience in the private sector, he will teach a graduate level course about the basics of cyber offense and defense to students without technical backgrounds as part of the Ford Dorsey Master’s in International Policy program at the Freeman Spogli Institute, which houses CISAC.</p>

<p>"With our country facing unprecedented challenges in digital interference with the democratic process and numerous other cybersecurity issues, Alex’s experience and perspective are a welcome addition to our group of fellows,” said Freeman Spogli Institute Director <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/michael_a_mcfaul">Michael McFaul</a>.</p>

<p>In his role, Stamos will also engage in research projects aimed at public policy initiatives as a member of the Faculty Working Group on Information Warfare. The working group will develop, discuss and test concepts and theories about information warfare, as well as conduct applied research on countermeasures to identify and combat information warfare. The working group will also develop policy outreach in briefings to government officials, public seminars and workshops, Congressional testimony, online and traditional media appearances, op-eds and other forms of educating the public on combatting information warfare.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled that Alex is devoting even more energy to our cyber efforts,” said CISAC Co-Director <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/amy_zegart">Amy Zegart</a>. “He's been a vital partner to the Stanford cyber policy program for several years and his Stanford "hack lab"--which he piloted in Spring 2018--is a cutting-edge class to train students in our new master’s cyber policy track. He brings extraordinary skills and a unique perspective that will enrich our classes, research, and policy programs."</p>

<p>Over the past three years, the Hoover Institution and CISAC have jointly developed the Stanford Cyber Policy Program. &nbsp;Its mission is to solve the most important international cyber policy challenges by conducting policy-driven research across disciplines, serving as a trusted convener across sectors, and teaching the next generation. The program is led by Dr. Amy Zegart and Dr. Herbert Lin. Stamos has participated on the advisory board of the program since its inception.</p>

<p>“We look forward to working with Alex on some of the key cyber issues facing our world today," said <a href="https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-w-gilligan">Tom Gilligan</a>, director of the Hoover Institution. "He brings tremendous experience and perspective that will contribute to Hoover’s important research addressing our nation’s cyber security issues.”</p>

<p>“I am excited to join Stanford and for the opportunity to share my knowledge and expertise with a new generation of students--and for the opportunity to learn from colleagues and students across many disciplines at the university,” said Stamos.</p>

<p>A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Stamos studied electrical engineering and computer science. He later co-founded a successful security consultancy, iSEC Partners, and in 2014 he joined Yahoo as its chief information security officer. Stamos joined Facebook as chief security officer in June 2015, where he led Facebook’s internal investigation into targeted election-related influence campaigns via the social media platform.</p>

The Cambridge Analytica — Facebook saga has succeeded in bringing to public consciousness a significant security threat to our democracy, which until now has been relatively invisible in public debate: how failure to protect user’s digital privacy can have real world consequences for democratic processes, national security, and citizens’ liberty. Earlier un-nuanced assertions expressed by many in the technology community that “privacy is over” and users don’t care about how their data is shared, can no longer function as a dominant operating assumption. The hard reality ahead of us is how challenging it will be to protect citizens’ privacy in a context where digital platforms, tools and services are intertwined with our daily lives. The bottom line is that digital platforms now will be required to have much more nuanced conversations with their users about the tradeoffs of using free services in exchange for monetizing personal data. This will have consequences for Facebook’s business model and all freemium digital services.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="74d4" name="74d4">Congressional hearings are not an adequate vehicle for educating legislators about how to regulate digital platforms.</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="f95e" name="f95e">The range of complex, multilayered challenges that must be tackled to optimally govern digital platforms in democracy cannot be addressed effectively through a brief set of public hearings. Many Senators and members of Congress displayed a lack of understanding of how Facebook works, which strands of the debate warrant deeper inspection, or which issues must be prioritized to protect the liberty and security of citizens on digital platforms. Representatives jumped around from one subject to the next — from political bias in restricting content on Facebook, to whether Facebook is a monopoly, to whether citizens own their data, to the efficacy of user consent to terms of service — without adequately framing any of these important subjects. In effect, the Senate and Congressional hearings themselves were shown to be poor vehicles for deepening regulators’ knowledge or helping progress toward an optimal approach to regulating Facebook or other digital platforms. Other than moving toward passage of the bipartisan Honest Ads Act sponsored by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D), Mark Warner (D), and John McCain(R), which regulates political advertising on digital platforms in the same way as on television and radio, our representatives are not yet well-prepared to regulate digital services. A different mode of engagement between government representatives and technology companies must be developed, if legislators want to help protect citizens in the digital realm, while also allowing users to continue to enjoy the benefits of digital platforms they have come to rely upon in their daily lives.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">&nbsp;</figure><section class="section section--body section--first" name="7156"><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-height:270px;max-width:269px;"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-height="270" data-image-id="1*9nQugWjEZma7ce5aMmdvlA.png" data-scroll="native" data-width="269"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" alt="Photo of Allison Berke, executive director of the Stanford Cyber Initiative at FSI." data- src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9nQugWjEZma7ce5aMmdvlA.png"></div></div></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="10b7" name="10b7"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://fsi.stanford.edu/cyber/people/allison-berke" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data->Allison Berke</a>, executive director of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://fsi.stanford.edu/cyber/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data->Stanford Cyber Initiative</a> at FSI.

His notes — leaked, ironically, by a press photographer when left open on his table during a bathroom break — show prepared language to address calls for his own resignation, and for compensation for users whose data was improperly shared, though these topics were not raised during questioning. Despite promising to work with legislators on regulations, Zuckerberg stopped short of proposing specific measures. Though he voiced his support of the Honest Ads Act, when asked if he would return to Washington to aid its passage, he offered someone on his team instead and noted that he “doesn’t come to Washington too often.” The implications, both that he doesn’t need to and that he doesn’t want to be involved in forming regulations, revealed a relationship between Facebook and lawmakers with distance, shading from incomprehension to distrust to antagonism, on both sides.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9fde" name="9fde">Many of those watching the hearings noted the Senators’ and Representatives’ clunky and repetitive lines of questioning, their difficulty choosing the precise terminology to communicate the technological gist of their inquiries, and the inability of a five-minute oral format to properly convey — and convey strictly enough to reign in a witness looking for a question’s easiest possible interpretation — the nuance in, for example, the points made by Senators Blunt and Wicker about Facebook’s cross-platform tracking between a device hosting a logged-in Facebook app and a device registered to the same user but lacking the Facebook login.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7d9d" name="7d9d">One could imagine a more collegial relationship between Facebook and Washington DC, in which representatives would have discussed their questions with Zuckerberg and his team at greater length, and perhaps behind closed doors, and could use the testimonial hearing format to place prior agreements and understandings on the record. Facebook’s apparent openness to exploring regulation should be taken as an opportunity by policymakers, both to craft regulation that may need to be complex — to cover the myriad ways in which data can be collected and mixed, and to ensure that a savvy company can’t avoid both compliance and detection — and to forge a closer relationship between the tech giant and its community representatives. That may require Zuckerberg visiting Washington a little more often, and it will also require the acquisition of more technological knowledge and expertise by legislators and their staff, which may require them to visit Silicon Valley more, too.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--body section--last" name="df79"><hr><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing" id="38bb" name="38bb">Views expressed here do not necessarily represent those of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies or Stanford University, both of which are nonpartisan institutions.</p></div></div></section><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

Talk from 5:30pm - 6:45pm.</strong></h4><p><strong>RSVP required <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-consequences-of-technological-developments-for-politics-and-government-tickets-44347133470">online</a>.</strong></p><p><em>The consequences of contemporary technological innovations for the lives and values of future generations are enormous. The wide range of expected – and unexpected – applications require rethinking governance arrangements, legal regimes, economic structures, and social relations. Exploration of such topics is the subject of the 2017-18 CASBS symposium series.</em><br><br>The first symposium, held in November 2017, focused on “AI, Automation, and Society.” Read about and view a video of that event <a href="https://casbs.stanford.edu/casbs-panel-discussion-focuses-ai-automation-society" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>The second symposium, held in March 2018, involved “The Effects of Technology on Human Interactions.” View the event video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jrMkenFWIo&amp;t=38s" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br><strong>In this final installment of the 2017-18 series, CASBS presents a conversation featuring two 2017-18 CASBS fellows – Stanford professor Nate Persily, an expert on law, democracy, and the internet; and Carrie Cihak, a senior policy expert and practitioner at one of the most innovative county governments in the U.S. They will outline the challenges that recent technology-based advances pose to democracy, public policy, and governance systems. Social media platforms increasingly are viewed as vehicles for exploiting political discourse, rather than as democratizing forces. How should our institutions respond? Though modern technological innovations more easily connect people, what are the implications for issues of “digital equity,” government capacity, and regulatory frameworks? Though the positive impacts are substantial, how do we address the numerous negative impacts of the technology sector’s concentration in certain regional economies – including the San Francisco Bay Area and the greater Seattle area? These are just a few questions that will stimulate a thought-provoking discussion between the panelists and with the audience.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>As Chief of Policy for King County Executive Dow Constantine, the highest ranking elected official of King County, WA, the 13th largest county in the United States, <strong>Carrie S. Cihak</strong> is responsible for identifying the highest priority policy areas and community outcomes for leadership focus and for developing and launching innovative solutions to issues that are complex, controversial and cross-sectoral. She is an architect of some of the county’s key initiatives, such as <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/initiatives/best-starts-for-kids.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Best Starts for Kids</a> as well as nationally-recognized work on <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/equity-social-justice.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">equity and social justice</a>. Prior to her work in Constantine’s administration, Cihak served for eight years as a senior-level analyst for the King County Council and as lead staff for the King County Board of Health. She also served as a staff economist on international trade and finance for President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. As a policy fellow during the 2017-18 academic year, Cihak is leading projects at CASBS and in King County that advance meaningful collaboration between academic researchers and governments. She is spearheading efforts in King County on evidence-informed decision making and is co-director of CASBS’s Impact Evaluation Design Lab, launched in March 2018. She is also using time at CASBS to explore the science and evidence-base of belonging, while working back home to help launch a cross-sector partnership called “You Belong Here,” which seeks to build civic muscle and inclusive growth in the Seattle region.</em></p><p><br><em><strong>Nate Persily</strong> is the James B. McClatchy Professor of Law at Stanford Law School, with appointments in the departments of political science, communication and the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. Prior to joining Stanford, Persily taught at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and as a visiting professor at Harvard, NYU, Princeton, the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Melbourne. His scholarship and legal practice focus on American election law or what is sometimes called the “law of democracy,” which addresses issues such as voting rights, political parties, campaign finance, redistricting, and election administration. He has served as a special master or court-appointed expert to craft congressional or legislative districting plans for Georgia, Maryland, Connecticut, New York and, most recently, North Carolina. He also served as the Senior Research Director for the Presidential Commission on Election Administration. In addition to numerous articles (many cited by the Supreme Court) on the legal regulation of political parties, issues surrounding the census and redistricting process, voting rights, and campaign finance reform, Persily is </em>coauthor<em> of an election law casebook, The Law of Democracy. As a fellow at CASBS supported by the Annenberg Foundation, he is examining the impact of changing technology on political communication, campaigns, and election administration. In 2016, he received an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship to pursue this work. Persily also co-directs the Stanford Project on Democracy and the Internet.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>*<span>There will be valet parking at the event.</span></em></p></div>
