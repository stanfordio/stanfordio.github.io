With technology a critical determinant of future military advantage, a key driver of economic prosperity, and a potent tool for the promotion of different models of governance, the stakes could not be higher. To compete, China is leveraging its formidable scale—whether measured in terms of research and development expenditures, data sets, scientists and engineers, venture capital, or the reach of its leading technology companies. The only way for the United States to tip the scale back in its favor is to deepen cooperation with allies.

Although COVID-19’s earliest origins may remain uncertain, the story of one volley in the ongoing U.S.-China blame game shows that misinformation about the disease can be traced to specific speculations, distortions, and amplifications.&nbsp;</p><p>A hostile messaging war between U.S. and Chinese officials seeking to deflect blame for the pandemic’s harms has included the U.S. president <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239685852093169664?s=20">labeling the pandemic a “Chinese virus”</a> to a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823">spreading unfounded speculation</a> that the U.S. military had a hand in introducing the virus to Wuhan. That speculation fed off of widely debunked theories that the virus was human-engineered and the fact that U.S. military personnel took part in the Military World Games in Wuhan in October 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">On March 12, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, took to Twitter with a video clip in which U.S. Centers for Disease Control chief Robert Redfield said some patients who died from COVID-19 might not have been tested. Zhao added: “It might be US army [sic] who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt data-delta="1" data-fid="241781" data-media-element="1" src="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/epsa_crop/public/000_tweet_1.png?itok=rJaENz0F" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; height: 451px; width: 400px;" title typeof="foaf:Image"><br><em><span style="color:#696969;">Lijian Zhao shares a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823"><span style="color:#696969;">tweet</span></a><span style="color:#696969;"> alleging U.S. military involvement in introducing the virus to Wuhan.</span></em><br>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">A few hours later, Zhao shared an article from a conspiracy site entitled “Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US.”</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt data-delta="2" data-fid="241782" data-media-element="1" src="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/epsa_crop/public/000_tweet_2.png?itok=gXkWodx6" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; height: 265px; width: 400px;" title typeof="foaf:Image"><br><em><span style="color:#696969;">Another </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238269193427906560"><span style="color:#696969;">Tweet</span></a><span style="color:#696969;"> by Lijian Zhao claiming to have evidence for a U.S. origin of the virus.</span></em><br>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zhao’s implication that the United States and its military could be behind Wuhan’s outbreak, even inadvertently, sparked outrage. The U.S. government <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/state-department-chinese-ambassador-coronavirus/index.html">summoned </a>Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, over the remarks. Cui later publicly <a href="https://www.axios.com/china-coronavirus-ambassador-cui-tiankai-1b0404e8-026d-4b7d-8290-98076f95df14.html">disavowed the U.S. military conspiracy theory</a>, and Chinese officials have not further amplified it.</p><p dir="ltr">Groundless speculation about the origins of the pandemic did not begin with Zhao, but the case of his eye-catching tweets reveals how China’s changing propaganda tactics have interacted with mangled news reporting, social media conspiracy theorizing, and underlying U.S.-China tensions—all resulting in high-profile misinformation about a public health crisis.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">An examination of social media posts across Weibo, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit in English, Chinese, and Japanese reveals the context and pathways that brought this particular conspiracy theory to Chinese state media and diplomatic channels. Weeks of speculation and online conspiracy theorizing about military links to the virus’ origins or emergence, combined with a broadening uncertainty about the circumstances of Wuhan’s outbreak and increasingly brittle U.S.-China rhetoric, laid the groundwork for Zhao’s inflammatory tweets and the reaction that followed.</p><h1 dir="ltr">Theories Involving the U.S. Military Circulated on Social Media as Early as January</h1><p dir="ltr">Speculation or conspiracy theory writings about a potential role for the U.S. military in Wuhan’s outbreak circulated weeks before Zhao, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, amplified the idea on Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">Since several platforms have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-tech-firms-renew-alert-system-to-fight-coronavirus-disinformation-11583946710">pledged to remove disinformation related to the origin of the coronavirus</a>, and our research started in mid-March, some materials could have been removed. Still, speculation about a U.S. role can be traced at least as far back as January. Though the earliest speculation did not necessarily catch on, some early references include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">January 2: a Chinese-language YouTube channel had shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsiGYrIZgjE">video dismissing the idea</a> that the pneumonia in Wuhan was the result of U.S. genetic warfare, which could imply at least some dissemination of the idea prior to this.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">January 20: a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/wumei90024873/status/1219054607873249281">claimed</a> the virus was 90% similar to one that had earlier been reported to a U.S. viral gene database.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">January 21: another Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/MBQXS/status/1219501251840266240">wrote</a> plainly that the “pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan” was caused by a “biochemical weapon developed by the U.S. military.”</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">January 31: <a href="https://www.ixigua.com/pseries/6803293447303365128_6787547997711368715/?logTag=BxhIc2JyXJ411-2QvS21n">a video appearing to be an old TV segment on alleged U.S. biological warfare during the Korean war</a> was shared to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlag84AJwFQ">YouTube</a> with a title asking, “Were SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 U.S. Plots?”</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">By February 1, Twitter activity included speculation that the virus was linked to U.S. attendance at the Military World Games, which took place in Wuhan in October 2019—an idea that featured in the conspiracy theory article Zhao shared almost six weeks later.

The <a href="https://twitter.com/ChineseEmbSA/status/1236322524281044993?s=20">Chinese Embassy in South Africa</a> amplified that point on Twitter on March 8.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zhao was not only expressing uncertainty about origins; he was pushing back against persistent efforts to label SARS-CoV-2 a “Chinese virus” weeks after the World Health Organization had designated the disease “COVID-19” <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/11/802352351/new-coronavirus-gets-an-official-name-from-the-world-health-organization">in part</a> to avoid stigma related to geographically-linked names like “Wuhan Coronavirus.”</p><p dir="ltr">The criticism aimed at China’s government over its handling of the outbreak had been wide-ranging, and U.S. officials had also engaged in some conspiracy theorizing of their own. Senator Tom Cotton, for instance, had advanced a number of unfounded or speculative theories about the virus’ origin in <a href="https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1222962874932453377">late January</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/18/politics/coronavirus-cotton-fact-check/index.html">February</a>. A conspiracy theorist talk radio website had also <a href="https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/news-nation/proof-the-novel-coronavirus-infecting-the-world-is-a-military-bio-weapon-developed-by-china-s-army">claimed</a> “proof” that the virus was a Chinese military bioweapon in an article <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/11/hal-turner-radio-show/far-right-radio-host-hal-turner-promotes-unproven-/">rated</a> “false” by Politifact.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">By the time Zhao was pushing the U.S. military import theory and his Foreign Ministry colleagues were questioning whether the virus came from China at all, therefore, the U.S.–China blame game dynamic over the virus had already incorporated unsupported theories.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Zhao’s March 12 speculation on Twitter that “It might be US army [sic] who brought the epidemic to Wuhan” drew widespread public attention, as Chinese government spokespeople had long made even their more inflammatory claims from the podium, as opposed to on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Zhao’s tweet was in part based on testimony by U.S. CDC Director Robert Redfield that it was possible some U.S. deaths assumed to be caused by influenza were actually COVID-19 cases—a message Zhao’s boss Hua Chunying, the ministry’s top spokesperson, also leveraged to <a href="https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1238003509510856704">argue</a> “It is absolutely WRONG and INAPPROPRIATE to call this the Chinese coronavirus.”</p><p dir="ltr">This louder, more assertive online behavior from Chinese diplomats could well be the new normal. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-diplomacy-insight/in-china-a-young-diplomat-rises-as-aggressive-foreign-policy-takes-root-idUSKBN21I0F8">reported</a> that Chinese leader Xi Jinping issued handwritten instructions last year to show a “fighting spirit.”</p><h1 dir="ltr">False Narratives on COVID-19’s Origins Remain Widespread</h1><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Zhao’s attention-grabbing tweets and statements from the Foreign Ministry podium may or may not set the tone for future Chinese government messaging.

The CCP has been attempting <a href="https://qz.com/1812162/china-mobilizes-against-medias-malicious-coronavirus-coverage/">to control the narrative</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/beijings-coronavirus-propaganda-blitz-goes-global-f2bc610c-e83f-4890-9ff8-f49521ad6a14.html">deflect blame</a> since the start of the outbreak, both domestically and abroad. It has done this by drawing on its substantial state- and CCP-owned media apparatus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Chinese state media produces and disseminates daily English-language content to English-speaking audiences via Facebook and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000007024807/china-coronavirus-propaganda.html">Twitter</a> (platforms that are technically banned in China). Chinese state media’s English-language Facebook pages post very frequently, and have extremely large audiences. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalTVNetwork/">CGTN</a> has over 96 million Page likes; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnn/">CNN</a> in contrast has only 32 million. These media properties <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=565225540184937">run ads regularly</a> to grow their audiences, which suggests that China invests in these pages as a tool for communicating its message to the English-speaking world. Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=inactive&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=565225540184937">Ads Library</a> shows specific regional ad targeting in India (Punjab State), Nepal, Bangladesh (Dhaka) and the Philippines (Manila), suggesting that English is used to communicate state views to a broad global audience.</p><p dir="ltr">To look at how coronavirus narratives targeting English-speaking audiences have played out on Chinese state media, and how they evolved as the outbreak has moved through various phases, we analyzed a data set of Facebook posts containing the keyword “coronavirus” from two distinct sets of media properties: 1) a collection of English-language Chinese (state) media outlets, and 2) a collection of U.S. media outlets*. This “coronavirus” dataset contained 6,870 posts from Chinese media between December 31, 2019 and March 16, 2020, and 13,522 posts from U.S. media outlets over the same period. While Chinese media has increased its coronavirus coverage in January and stayed at a consistent level since then, U.S. media Facebook posts on the coronavirus stayed at low levels until late February, then soared (see histograms below).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img alt data-delta="1" data-fid="241576" data-media-element="1" src="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/epsa_crop/public/01_histograms_all.png?itok=g7-n4jTq" title typeof="foaf:Image"><br><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Chinese outlets (left) increase the number of Facebook posts on coronavirus in late January.

Chinese outlets included many articles with a focus on positive stories such as the number of recovered patients and examples of successful treatments, while U.S. media reported on new cases of infections and trends in death. For example, Chinese state media reported on a coronavirus patient who gave birth to a healthy baby not infected with coronavirus, whereas the U.S. media told the story of a different <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-06-20-intl-hnk/h_df78de2753d47e6e165059195da64f50">newborn</a> in Wuhan who had become the youngest coronavirus patient. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-06-20-intl-hnk/h_df78de2753d47e6e165059195da64f50">CNN</a> credited the story’s source as Chinese state media CCTV, yet no English-language Chinese state media posted this story on their Facebook pages.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt data-delta="2" data-fid="241578" data-media-element="1" src="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/epsa_crop/public/02_media_on_baby.png?itok=P6kjWgHJ" title typeof="foaf:Image"><br><em><span style="color:#696969;">Chinese state outlet</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chinadaily/posts/10158107401431291"><span style="color:#696969;"> China Daily</span></a><span style="color:#696969;"> (left) reports on a baby born to a coronavirus patient with no infection, whereas </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnn/posts/10160429327746509"><span style="color:#696969;">CNN</span></a><span style="color:#696969;"> (right) reports on a newborn baby becoming the youngest person diagnosed with coronavirus</span></em></p><p dir="ltr">We searched our dataset for the word “patient” and analyzed words commonly used before or after “patient” in Facebook posts made by Chinese state media and U.S. mainstream media. From December 31, 2019 to March 16, 2020, the term “infected” was commonly used in connection with “patient” in both the American and Chinese media (see word clouds below). However, beyond that common term, there are significant divergences, such as the U.S. media reporting on patients as “sick” or “affected”, and the Chinese media frequently mentioning treatment- and recovery-related terms such as “treating”, “recovered”, “discharged” and “cured”.</p><p dir="ltr"><img alt data-delta="3" data-fid="241580" data-media-element="1" src="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/epsa_crop/public/03_patient_narrative.png?itok=pQsYO8rm" title typeof="foaf:Image"><br><span style="color:#696969;"><em>Words frequently used in connection with the word “patient” by Chinese media (left) and U.S. media (right); Exclude “patient” and the term “coronavirus” for better visibility of other terms.

Leishenshan and Huoshenshan hospitals were built in just a few days in late January to early February. Chinese state media disseminated stories about how the international community was “impressed” with China’s rapid building capacity, calling the quick progress of the construction a “miracle.” U.S. media also reported on the rapid building of the hospitals but presented them in a less positive light, saying they were a response to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/international/china-virus-wuhan-building-new-hospital-coronavirus-2020-1/?r=US&amp;IR=T">overwhelmed</a> medical facilities or that the temporary structures should not be characterized as hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<img alt data-delta="5" data-fid="241581" data-media-element="1" src="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/s3/files/styles/epsa_crop/public/04_hospital_narrative_both_copy.png?itok=WNxeZqfu" title typeof="foaf:Image"><br><em><span style="color:#696969;">Chinese state outlet </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalTVNetwork/posts/3946024018771722"><span style="color:#696969;">CGTN</span></a><span style="color:#696969;"> (left) calls the hospital a “construction miracle”, whereas </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NPR/posts/10158917095001756"><span style="color:#696969;">NPR</span></a><span style="color:#696969;"> (right) reports on the building, but qualifies it that the term “hospital” for the building ”may not be exactly on point”</span></em></p><h1 dir="ltr">The Li Wenliang Case</h1><p dir="ltr">A significant story that played out as the coronavirus outbreak unfolded was that of late whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang, who was one of the first to report the existence of the novel disease warning fellow medics in a chat group on December 30, 2019. His warnings were shared publicly and reached a wide audience online. On January 3, 2020 police detained and forced him to sign a letter stating he had made “false comments.” In a late January post on Chinese social media Weibo, Li reported from his hospital bed that he was in an <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3049561/dr-li-wenliang-who-was-he-and-how-did-he-become-coronavirus-hero">intensive care unit with breathing difficulty</a>. Li Wenliang died of COVID-19 on February 7, 2020 at age 34. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang">significant public anger</a> that erupted over his death created a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/24/xi-jinping-coronavirus-china-covid-19-quarantine/">very dangerous moment for the Chinese regime</a>, and required Chinese media to delicately balance covering his story without casting the Chinese government in a bad light.</p><p dir="ltr">In our dataset, there are 24 posts by Chinese media and 24 posts by U.S. media containing “Li Wenliang”. The word clouds below represent the 50 most common words used in these articles after filtering out common words such as “the” and excluding the terms “coronavirus”, “li”, and “wenliang”. While in U.S. media, prominent terms associated with Li Wenliang include “silenced”, and “authorities”, these terms are notably absent in Chinese media. Chinese media instead focus on him being an “ophthalmologist” and expressing “condolences”.</p><p dir="ltr">  <div data-delta="6" data-fid="241583" data-media-element="1" title typeof="foaf:Image">

In the U.S. media environment, the Fox News network has also dramatically shifted their coverage of the coronavirus disease in response to political considerations, adjusting their coverage to make the U.S. executive branch leadership look like leaders. This tone change was so brazen that the Washington Post labeled it “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/on-fox-news-suddenly-a-very-different-tune-about-the-coronavirus/2020/03/16/7a7637cc-678f-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html">a petri dish for misinformation</a>.” While we did not include far left or far right U.S. media sources in our data set for the above analysis, other US news outlets also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/10/military-surgeon-trump-is-right-on-the-seasonal-flu-being-more-dangerous-than-coronavirus/">downplayed the threat</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the latest activity from the U.S. media, there is now a dichotomy in coverage: many conservative outlets are accusing the Chinese government of causing a global pandemic due to the significant missteps in their early response, and deflecting blame from the Trump Administration's own failures.

Some of the issues he has studied include technology and labor markets, entrepreneurship and economic growth, entrepreneurship education, and education and inequality.

<p>His research has been published in both economics and management journals including the <em>Journal of Urban Economics</em>, <em>Journal of Economic Geography</em>, <em>Journal of Business Venturing</em>, <em>Journal of Health Economics</em>, and <em>Labour Economics</em>. Lee also regularly contributes to policy reports and opinion pieces on contemporary issues surrounding both North and South Korea.</p>

            <div class="node people body text-with-summary label-hidden text-long"><p>Larry Diamond is the William L. Clayton Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,&nbsp;the Mosbacher Senior Fellow in Global Democracy at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), and a Bass University Fellow in Undergraduate Education at Stanford University. He is also professor by courtesy of Political Science and Sociology at Stanford, where he lectures and teaches courses on democracy (including an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/democracy/stanford-university-comparative-democratic-development-part-i-conditions-of-democracy" target="_blank">online course</a> on EdX). At the Hoover Institution, he co-leads the Project on Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific Region and participates in the Project on the U.S., China, and the World.&nbsp;At FSI, he is among the core faculty of the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law, which he directed for six and a half years. He leads FSI’s Israel Studies Program and is a member of the Program on Arab Reform and Development.&nbsp;He also co-leads the Global Digital Policy Incubator, based at FSI’s Cyber Policy Center. He served for 32 years as founding co-editor of the <em>Journal of Democracy</em>.</p><p>Diamond’s research focuses on global trends affecting freedom and democracy and on U.S. and international policies to defend and advance democracy. His book,&nbsp;<em>Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency</em>, analyzes the challenges confronting liberal democracy in the United States and around the world at this potential “hinge in history,” and offers an agenda for strengthening and defending democracy at home and abroad.&nbsp; A paperback edition with a new preface was released by Penguin in April 2020.&nbsp;His other books include:&nbsp;<em>In Search of Democracy (2016)</em>, <em>The Spirit of Democracy&nbsp;</em>(2008),&nbsp;<em>Developing Democracy: Toward Consolidation (1999), Promoting Democracy in the 1990s&nbsp;</em>(1995), and&nbsp;<em>Class, Ethnicity, and Democracy in Nigeria&nbsp;</em>(1989). He has edited or coedited more than fifty books, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hoover.org/research/chinas-influence-and-american-interests" target="_blank"><em>China’s Influence and American Interests</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(2019, with Orville Schell),&nbsp;<a href="///Silicon%20Triangle/%20The%20United%20States,%20Taiwan,%20China,%20and%20Global%20Semiconductor%20Security" target="_blank"><em>Silicon Triangle: The United States, China, Taiwan the Global Semiconductor Security</em></a> (2023, with James O. Ellis Jr. and Orville Schell), and&nbsp;<a href="https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/The-Troubling-State-of-India-s-Democracy3" target="_blank"><em>The Troubling State of India’s Democracy</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(2024, with Sumit Ganguly and Dinsha Mistree).</p><p>During 2002–03, Diamond served as a consultant to the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and was a contributing author of its report,&nbsp;<em>Foreign Aid in the National Interest</em>. He has advised and lectured to universities and think tanks around the world, and to the World Bank, the United Nations, the State Department, and other organizations dealing with governance and development. During the first three months of 2004, Diamond served as a senior adviser on governance to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. His 2005 book,&nbsp;<em>Squandered Victory: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq</em>, was one of the first books to critically analyze America's postwar engagement in Iraq.</p><p>Among Diamond’s other edited books are&nbsp;<em>Democracy in Decline?; Democratization and Authoritarianism in the Arab World</em>;&nbsp;<em>Will China Democratize?</em>; and&nbsp;<em>Liberation Technology: Social Media and the Struggle for Democracy</em>, all edited with Marc F. Plattner; and&nbsp;<em>Politics and Culture in Contemporary Iran</em>, with Abbas Milani. With Juan J. Linz and Seymour Martin Lipset, he edited the series,&nbsp;<em>Democracy in Developing Countries</em>, which helped to shape a new generation of comparative study of democratic development.</p><p><a href="https://fsi9-prod.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/diamond_encina_hall_0.png" target="_blank"><em>Download full-resolution headshot</em></a><em>; photo credit: Rod Searcey.</em></p></div>
